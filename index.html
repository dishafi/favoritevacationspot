        <p>You know how people love to brag about their awesome vacations — sharing all the cool places they’ve been and what made one trip so special? My experience is a bit different — I haven’t traveled much.</p>
        <p>When I was a kid, a vacation meant spending the summer at my grandparents’ house. Don’t get me wrong, I really enjoyed being there, but I always thought that was just how vacations were meant to be — a long, lazy summer at Grandma’s. Looking back, I realize those trips weren’t really my vacation at all; they were more like a bonus break for my parents, who got three whole months without me and my older brother. What a dream for them! Haha.</p>

        <h3>How I Found My Paradise</h3>
        <p>Last year, I finally decided to go on a vacation by myself. The challenge was finding a place where I could stay for a week without spending too much money.</p>
        <p>One evening, I was talking to my friend about it, and she suggested Hawaii. I laughed and said, "Sure, just find me a place to sell a kidney so I can afford it. Haha." But then she told me about the Big Island, specifically Pahoa. She even offered to help with free accommodation, so I would only need to pay for food and tickets. At first, I did not believe her, but she kept insisting that I deserved a break and should go.</p>
        <p>To keep it short, I went to Hawaii, and it was the best decision of my life. The place was different from what I expected. There were almost no tourists, just locals living there. It was a bit far from grocery stores, but the best part? It was right next to a volcano. Every morning, I watched the sunrise sitting on the dry lava, thinking about how beautiful life is.</p>

        <h3>My Experience in Pahoa</h3>
        <p>This vacation was exactly what I wanted. I spent my days reading books on the edge of the dry lava, watching the waves, listening to the ocean, and just enjoying the peace. One night, I even decided to sleep on the lava. Omg, it was amazing! Even though the lava was dry, it still had heat trapped inside, so when I lay down, it felt warm.</p>
        <p>I also visited these natural hot ponds that locals love. They were created after volcanic eruptions, like natural jacuzzis. Such an unbelievable experience!</p>
        <p> For the first time, I tried fresh coconut water and coconut, and it was delicious. Also, I had tried papaya before in Washington State and did not understand why people liked it, it tasted so bland. But when I tried Hawaiian papaya, I fell in love. The taste was completely different!</p>

        <h3>Why This Vacation Was Special</h3>
        <p>Pahoa is about 30 minutes from Hilo. Hilo is the largest town on the east side of the island, while Pahoa is a small, rural community known for its bohemian vibe, rainforests, and being close to volcanic activity. It is especially famous for the 2018 Kīlauea eruption, which reshaped the landscape, and the dry lava I mentioned was actually from that eruption. (I call it "dry lava", but I think people call it “lava rock” or “hardened lava”).</p>
        <p>My experience was completely different from most people who visit Hawaii. But honestly, it was exactly what I wanted. I got to connect with locals, eat amazing food, visit weekend markets, sunbathe, swim in the ocean, and appreciate everything I have.</p>
