        <h3>What Vacation Meant to Me</h3>

        <p>You know how people love to brag about their awesome vacations, sharing all the cool places they have been and what made one trip so special? Well, my experience is a bit different... I haven’t traveled much.</p>
        <p>As a kid, a vacation meant spending the summer at my grandparents’ house. Don’t get me wrong, I really enjoyed being there. But I always thought that’s just how vacations were supposed to be: a long, lazy summer at Grandma’s.</p>
        <p>Looking back, I realize those trips weren’t really my vacations at all. They were more like a bonus break for my parents, who got three whole months without me and my older brother. What a dream for them! Haha.</p>

        <h3>How I Found My Paradise</h3>

        <p>Last year, I finally decided to go on a little solo trip. The challenge? Finding a place where I could stay for a week without spending too much money.</p>
        <p>One evening, I was talking to my friend about it, and she suggested Hawaii. I laughed and said, "Sure, just find me a place to sell a kidney so I can afford it. Haha." But then she told me about the Big Island, specifically Pahoa. She even offered to help with free accommodation, so I would only need to pay for food and tickets. At first, I did not believe her, but she kept insisting that I deserved a break and should go.</p>
        <p>Long story short, I went to Hawaii, and it was the best decision of my life. The place was nothing like I expected. There were almost no tourists, just locals living their everyday lives. It was a bit far from grocery stores, but the best part? It was right next to a volcano. Every morning, I watched the sunrise while sitting on the dry lava, just thinking about how beautiful life is.</p>

        <h3>My Experience in Pahoa</h3>
        <div class="section-content">

        <p>This vacation was exactly what I needed. I spent my days reading books on the edge of the dry lava, watching the waves, listening to the ocean, and simply enjoying the peace. One night, I even decided to sleep on the lava. Omg, it was amazing! Even though the lava was dry, it still trapped heat inside, so when I lay down, it felt warm and cozy.</p>
        <p>I also visited these natural hot ponds that locals love—formed after volcanic eruptions, like nature’s own jacuzzis. Such an unbelievable experience!</p>
        <p>For the first time, I tried fresh coconut water and coconut, and they were absolutely delicious. I also gave papaya another chance. I had tried it before in Washington State and never understood  why people liked it, it tasted so bland. But Hawaiian papaya? A whole different story. It was rich, sweet, and full of flavor. I just fell in love.</p>

        <p>Pahoa is about 30 minutes from Hilo. While Hilo is the largest town on the east side of the island, Pahoa is a small, rural community known for its bohemian vibe, lush rainforests, and proximity to volcanic activity. It’s especially famous for the 2018 Kilauea eruption, which reshaped the landscape. The dry lava I mentioned earlier actually came from that eruption.Pahoa is about 30 minutes from Hilo.

(I call it "dry lava," but I think the right way to call it is "lava rock" or "hardened lava").</p>
        <p>My experience was completely different from most people who visit Hawaii. But honestly, it was exactly what I wanted. I got to connect with locals, eat amazing food, visit weekend markets, sunbathe, swim in the ocean, and truly appreciate everything I have.</p>
