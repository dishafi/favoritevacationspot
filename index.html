        <h3>What Vacation Meant to Me</h3>
        <p>You know how people love to brag about their awesome vacations — sharing all the cool places they’ve been and what made one trip so special? My experience is a bit different — I haven’t traveled much.</p>
        <p>When I was a kid, a vacation meant spending the summer at my grandparents’ house. Don’t get me wrong, I really enjoyed being there, but I always thought that was just how vacations were meant to be — a long, lazy summer at Grandma’s. Looking back, I realize those trips weren’t really my vacation at all; they were more like a bonus break for my parents, who got three whole months without me and my older brother. What a dream for them! Haha.</p>

        <h3>How I Found My Paradise</h3>
        <p>With a tight budget, I never imagined Hawaii as an option. But thanks to a friend's suggestion and free accommodation, I found myself on the Big Island, ready for an adventure.</p>

        <h3>My Experience in Pahoa</h3>
        <p>Unlike touristy spots, Pahoa was peaceful and raw. I spent my days reading on dry lava, watching waves, and listening to the ocean. One night, I even slept on the warm lava rock—an unforgettable experience.</p>
        <p>I also visited natural hot ponds formed by volcanic eruptions and enjoyed fresh tropical fruits like coconut and papaya, which tasted completely different from store-bought ones.</p>

        <h3>Why This Vacation Was Special</h3>
        <p>This was more than a vacation; it was a chance to connect with nature, meet locals, and experience life on a volcanic island. It was peaceful, simple, and exactly what I needed.</p>
